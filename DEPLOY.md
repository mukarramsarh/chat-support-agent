# Deploying to cPanel (shared hosting)

Target example: **`https://staging-dev.procurementhub.sa/chatbot`** — the app in a
`/chatbot` sub-folder of the `staging-dev` subdomain. No Docker or Node needed —
pure PHP + MySQL.

> The chatbot backend can live anywhere; your website just loads a `<script>` from
> it. Hosting it under `/chatbot` works because the app supports `APP_BASE_PATH`.

## 0. Prerequisites
- cPanel with **PHP 8.1+**, and the extensions: `pdo_mysql`, `curl`, `mbstring`, `json`, `zip`.
- A way to run one CLI command (either **cPanel → Terminal**, or a one-off **Cron Job**).
- Your API keys: **Gemini** (chat) + **OpenAI** (embeddings). Anthropic & Pinecone optional.

## 1. Upload the code
Put the app in a `chatbot` folder inside the `staging-dev` subdomain's document root, e.g.
`~/staging-dev.procurementhub.sa/chatbot/`.

- **Terminal:** `git clone https://github.com/mukarramsarh/chat-support-agent.git chatbot`
- **or** download the repo ZIP and upload/extract via **File Manager**.

The included root `.htaccess` forwards requests into `public/`, so you do NOT need to
change the subdomain's document root.

## 2. Install dependencies
- **Terminal:** `cd chatbot && composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader`
- **No composer?** Run `composer install` locally and upload the resulting `vendor/` folder.

## 3. Create the database
cPanel → **MySQL Databases** → create a database + user, give the user all privileges.
Note the DB name, user, and password.

## 4. Run the web installer
Open **`https://staging-dev.procurementhub.sa/chatbot/install`** and fill in:
- **Database:** host `localhost`, the DB name / user / password from step 3 (the
  chatbot's own database).
- **CMS database:** a *different* database — the one the main procurementhub.sa CMS
  itself uses. There is no separate signup for the chatbot admin panel; login is
  verified live against the CMS's own `users` table (§7), so this must be correct or
  nobody can sign in. On cPanel-style hosting the CMS database is almost never
  literally named `procurementhub` — it's normally prefixed with your cPanel account
  username (e.g. `procurem_something`). Check cPanel → **MySQL Databases** for the
  exact name. Host/user/password default to the same values as the chatbot's own
  database above (fine when both share one MySQL server); only the database *name*
  usually needs to be different. The installer tests this connection (and that a
  `users` table exists) before continuing.
- **Public URL:** `https://staging-dev.procurementhub.sa/chatbot`
- **Sub-directory path:** `/chatbot`
- **API keys:** Gemini + OpenAI (paste your keys).
- **Embedding dimensions:** `1536` (default) — or `1024` if you use an existing 1024-dim Pinecone index.

Leave Pinecone blank to keep all vector data in your own MySQL (recommended for KSA data
residency). The installer tests the DB, runs the schema, writes `.env`, and self-locks.

If it can't write `.env` (permissions), it shows the file contents — create `.env` in the
`chatbot/` root with that text, then continue.

> Data residency tip: after install, set `VECTOR_DRIVER=php` in `.env` so embeddings are
> stored as vectors in your MySQL (nothing goes to Pinecone). Chat + embedding text still
> go to Google/OpenAI — keep PII redaction ON (see step 7).

## 5. Permissions
Ensure `chatbot/storage/` is writable (`755` or `775`). The installer's pre-flight page
flags this.

## 6. Seed the ProcurementHub data + context — **no terminal needed**
This creates the bilingual master prompt, 20 knowledge docs (company + Saudi
procurement/local-content), and the eval set.

**Easiest:** open `/chatbot/admin` and sign in with an existing procurementhub.sa CMS
admin/editor account (there is no separate signup here — see §7) → go to **Knowledge**
→ click **⚡ Seed ProcurementHub data**. (It runs while you're signed in.)

**Or by URL** (no login needed) — the installer generated a `SEED_TOKEN` in `.env`:
```
https://staging-dev.procurementhub.sa/chatbot/seed.php?token=YOUR_SEED_TOKEN
```
Open `.env` in cPanel **File Manager** to copy the token. It prints progress and a
summary. Takes ~30–60s (each document is embedded).

Re-running it is safe — it replaces the knowledge base with a fresh seed.

> Prefer CLI? `php bin/console demo` does the same thing.

## 7. Configure in the admin
Open **`/chatbot/admin`** and sign in — there is no signup form. Credentials are
checked live against the CMS's own `users` table (see step 4's **CMS database**
setting): use an existing CMS **admin** or **editor** account (email/username +
that account's actual CMS password). A CMS **contributor** role cannot sign in
here. First successful login auto-creates the matching local profile row
(`role: admin` → owner here, `editor` → admin here).
- **Agent** page → *Allowed embed domains*: add `procurementhub.sa` and `staging-dev.procurementhub.sa`.
- **Privacy & form** page → enable **RTL (Arabic)** if you want Arabic-first chrome; keep
  **PII redaction** ON; set a **retention** period if desired.
- Sidebar language switcher: **EN / العربية**.

## 8. Recurring cron (recrawl + memory + retention)
No terminal needed — the installer generated a `CRON_TOKEN` in `.env`.
cPanel → **Cron Jobs** → every 5 minutes:
```
curl -s "https://staging-dev.procurementhub.sa/chatbot/cron.php?token=YOUR_CRON_TOKEN"
```
> Have shell? `php /home/USER/.../chatbot/bin/console cron` works too.

## 9. Embed the widget on your website
Copy the exact snippet from the **Agent** page (it has your agent id). It looks like:
```html
<script src="https://staging-dev.procurementhub.sa/chatbot/widget.js"
  data-agent="YOUR_AGENT_PUBLIC_ID" defer></script>
```
Or open chat from your own button:
```html
<script src="https://staging-dev.procurementhub.sa/chatbot/widget.js"
  data-agent="YOUR_AGENT_PUBLIC_ID" data-launcher="off" defer></script>
<a href="#" data-support-ai-open>Chat with us</a>
```
